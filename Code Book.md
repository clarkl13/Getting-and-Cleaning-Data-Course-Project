##Identifiers

Activity_Type:  The type of activity performed when the measurements were taken (i.e. standing, walking, etc.)

##Measurements
tBodyAcc-mean()-X, tBodyAcc-mean()-Y, tBodyAcc-mean()-Z: The average time-domain body acceleration in the x, y or z direction 
tBodyAcc-std()-X, tBodyAcc-std()-Y, tBodyAcc-std()-Z: Standard deviation of the time-domain body acceleration in the X, Y and Z directions

All measurements are averaged for each subject ID and each activity.
